# Overview

This program is being created to demonstrate some of the basic abilities of Data analysis through using Python programming and pandas. It's purpose is to use a data set to find important information on the housing market to be displayed for the users use and knowledge. 

The data I'm using provides information about various aspects of homes, including the number of rooms, square footage, location, proximity to public transportation, number of stories, age, and price.

 As a young adult, I find delving into the housing market and planning for the future to be a daunting task. Through this software I believe it will greatly simplify the process of narrowing down home searches and establishing realistic expectations to start the home search experience. I chose this dataset to address three primary questions: first, what options are within a person's budget; second, what matches the person's preferences or needs, and third, what is the average home price in the dataset.

# Data Analysis Results

Question 1 - Can I input a desired maximum price and view the closest results and available houses under that price? Yes, you can organize and display homes from least expensive to most expensive based on the maximum price given.

Question 2 - Can you provide a list of specifics, such as the number of bedrooms, square footage of the home, and the age of the home, then categorize that information and display the prices of homes that meet the closest requirements, arranged from closest down? Yes, you can input specific requirements and sort through the dataset to organize and display the closest results along with the corresponding home prices.

# Development Environment

I used the Pandas website to gained a fundamental understanding of how to use the extension in Python. Additionally, I watched a variety of YouTube videos to gain visual insights into the concepts and methods for using Pandas with Python. 

I used Python as the programming language and utilized the Pandas extension to create an organized program capable of searching through a dataset and delivering responses to user questions.

# Future Work

* I want to make the Software more engaging to the user. Providing more question and answer, and "What to do next" segments.
* I want to add in a housing Price change segment. This would cover the chang of housing prices over an extended period of time to give reference to how much homes currently cost and may cost in the future. 
* I want to find a larger more specific database of the region of Idaho, instead of a broad database, that I am currently using.
